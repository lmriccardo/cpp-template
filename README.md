# C++ DevContainer Template

A ready-to-use **C++ development environment** with *VS Code Devcontainers*, pre-configured for rapid development using the *cmake* build system. This is the structure of the template:

```
.
├── .github/workflows/compile-ci.yml # GitHub Actions workflow
├── .devcontainer/devcontainer.json  # Devcontainer JSON definition
├── cmake/                           # (Optional) Custom CMake modules
├── src/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── app.cpp                  # Core application source
│   │   ├── app.hpp                  # Header file
│   └── main.cpp                     # Application entry point
├── CMakeLists.txt                   # Main CMake configuration
├── Dockerfile                       # Docker image creation file
└── README.md
```

The main `CMakeLists` file is already included with automatic testing capabilities using `ctest`. Just create the `test` folder.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmriccardo/cpp-template.git
mv cpp-template <ur-app-name>
```

### 2. Open in VS Code

- Install the [*Remote - Containers*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
- Open the folder in VS Code
- *Reopen in the container* when prompted

### 3. Build and Run

From the command line inside the container:

```bash
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]
cmake --build build [--target TARGET-NAME] # to build target(s)
./bin/APP-NAME # replace APP-NAME with the name of the executable
```

Otherwise, since the devcontainer has already installed all C++ development VS Code extensions you can just use the buttons of the status bar, selecting which targets to build, run or debug.

### 4. Outputs

- Libraries (created with `add_library`) are placed in the `lib` folder
- Executables (created with `add_executable`) are placed in the `bin` folder

Both folders are in the `.gitignore` file along with `log` and other folders.
